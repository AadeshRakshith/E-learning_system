          <p class="par"><br><br>Infinte computer solutions along with techademy have given aspiring engineers
           a beautiful opportunity to learn, implement and create resources. We would love to present 
           to you our project, E-learning system. In this new age world, we have come to terms with e-learning 
           which does not include the use of paper and pen. There are many advantages of e-learning
           system. In this e-learning system we can assign projects to students and can share
           documents and more easily. Our system has three modules including student,
           faculties and Admin. Students can login, they have access to main menu,
           calendar, projects, documentation, to upload, view the things uploaded by the
           faculties, knowledge books, also send messages to faculties. Faculties can login
           and have access for viewing, uploading documents and projects. Admin can login
           and manage the faculties and student details and also view projects. This is how
           we can adapt and learn in this ever changing world, and hence an e-learning system is an easier and smarter
           option for students and colleges.
